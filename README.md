# string_hash_generator
This script has the hability to generate hashes out of strings of alfanumeric text, it has 8 modes, it uses the hashlib library so its compatible with BLAKE, the code its very messy, so you can download it and  optimize it, you can use it on your script just credit me.


EXECUTE THE SCRIPT:

Due to the fact that the scripts needs the data.py it cant be converted to .exe, im gonna try unifing both file into one, just start the software with 

python String_Hash_Generator_V1.2.py

or

python3 String_Hash_Generator_V1.2.py

In probably a week or two im gonna implement SHA3 modes
